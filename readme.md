# Moody , beg to compile your code! (or don't and watch the compiler cry)

**Moody* is a playful, tone-sensitive programming language that only compiles your code if you‚Äôre polite enough. It supports basic control structures, recursion, and even enforces good manners through tone analysis.

##Installating and Executing Moody Code

- First download the MoodyLang Pckage from PyPi

```Moody
pip install moodylang==0.1.0
```
- Then create a new .moody file and run it as shown below
  
```Moody
moodyLang [file name].moody
```

## ‚úÖ Features

- Custom syntax influenced by JavaScript and Python.
- Mood-based keywords: Good, Neutral, Bad ‚Äî each affects your "tone score".
- Will **refuse to compile** if you're rude, impolite, or forget to say `thanks`.
- Supports:
  - Variable declarations (`let`, `const`)
  - Functions (`beg def myFunc() { ... }`)
  - Conditionals (`listen if`)
  - Loops (`plead while`)
  - Recursion
  - Polite `return` statements (`request`)
  - Tone-based printing (`humblyRequest`, `send`, `handover`)
- Interactive Interpreter: `python moody.py -i`

## üí¨ Tone Keywords

### Good (Boosts score, required):
- `beg`
- `prettyPlease`
- `plead`
- `request` ‚Üí becomes `return`
- `thanks`
- `humblyRequest` ‚Üí use before calling functions

Limit: 2 uses per keyword.

### Neutral (No impact, but limited):
- `hey`
- `sup`
- `listen`
- `yo`
- `btw`
- `proceed`
- `send` ‚Üí `return' but neutral

Limit: 1 use per keyword.

### Bad (Reduces tone score):
- `youBetter`
- `dare`
- `threaten`
- `submit`
- `now`
- `handover` ‚Üí `return` return but aggressive

Limit: 5 uses per keyword.

---

## ‚ùó Tone Rules

Your MoodyLang code **must**:
- Use **at least 3 good keywords**.
- Maintain a **minimum tone score of 6**.
- Include a **`thanks`** before finishing (Sort of like a return 0 in C++, don't use a semicolon in a thanks statement).

Violating these will result in:
- `FixYourAttitudeError`
- `CompilerIsCryingError`
- `GratitudeException`

Multiple errors can occur simultaneously.

## üìÑ Example: Polite Search

```moody
beg def linearSearch(n) {
    yo let i = 0;
    plead while (i < len(arr)) {
        listen if (arr[i] == n) {
            request i;
        }
        plead i = i + 1;
    }
    beg request -1;
}

hey const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
humblyRequest print(linearSearch(3));
thanks

    yo let i = 0;
    plead while (i < len(arr)) {
        listen if (arr[i] == n) {
            request i;
        }
        plead i = i + 1;
    }
    beg request -1;
}

hey const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
humblyRequest print(linearSearch(3));
thanks
```

## Code

# Since its interpreter is built with Python you can use regular Python code with a few adjustments:
- All variable declarations must begin with const or let
- Use Curly braces syntax and semicolons
- Every line must have one of the keywords
- use the **thanks** keyword to end your code
- return statements become request/hanover/send statements
- use **humblyRequest** before calling any functions
- Lastly, don't overuse keywords in your code!

heres another sample with most of these features demonstrated:
```Moody
beg def square(x) {
    request(x * x);
}

prettyPlease def double(x) {
    request(x + x);
}

plead def printResult(value) {
    humblyRequest print("The result is: " + str(value));
}

beg def main() {
    let num = 7;
    let sq = humblyRequest square(num);
    let dbl = humblyRequest double(num);
    
    humblyRequest printResult(sq);
    humblyRequest printResult(dbl);
}

humblyRequest main();
thanks
```
